A function that does not return a value is called a void function and has the keyword void in front of the function name. We do not have a reciever of this funtions meaning the funtion stands on its own and we do not have to do anything else than call it.

We used a global variable, you could also use another parameter in the print_number that the print_primes function increases and resets.
