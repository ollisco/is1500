# LAB1

## 1
- Which lines of code had to be changed? Why?
We changed row 14 which loads one to load three. (this is the stepsize)

We changed the row 16 which loads 0x5b (91) to 0x5d (93) since we step by three we need to break at somewhere
divisible by three.

## 2
If the return value is 17 what is the return value?
eight, since we remove all the bits above 15 ???!!!
